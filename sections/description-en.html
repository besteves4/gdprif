<h2 id="desc" class="list">GDPR Information flows: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
The GDPR Information Flows (GDPRIF) ontology aims to provide a tool to refer to the rights and obligations established in the 
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in terms of information flows 
that occur between GDPR stakeholders, where a stakeholder can be classified as 
a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/" target="_blank">data subject</a>, 
a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/" target="_blank">data controller</a>, 
a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/" target="_blank">data processor</a>, 
a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/" target="_blank">recipient</a>, 
a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-51-gdpr/" target="_blank">supervisory authority</a> 
or a <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-97/" target="_blank">data protection officer</a>.
In this context, an information flow refers to information that must be transmitted from one stakeholder to the other 
so that a right or obligation can be invoked and granted. 
<br>
The following figure provides an overview of the modelled information flows.
It is the result of an analysis of GDPR Chapter’s III and IV 
(<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-3/" target="_blank">Rights of the data subject</a> and 
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-4/" target="_blank">Controller and processor</a>, respectively), where each article 
was manually studied to search for interactions between stakeholders and, when a flow of information was identified between more
than one stakeholder, the respective interaction was recorded in the diagram.
The bidirectional arrows represent a right or obligation in which a request for information and respective response is expected, 
while the unidirectional arrows represent only a request or notification and no reply is expected.

<br><br>
Therefore, GDPRIF's main objective is to provide a way to model the relationships between GDPR stakeholders, the identified items of information 
that need to be exchanged, GDPR rights and obligations, and also to specify the flows of information and the events that trigger such flows. 
For instance, if a data subject invokes its 
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/" target="_blank">right to erasure</a>, along with the request 
that triggers the flow of information, there is the need to represent information related to the ground on which the request 
is based (GDPR's Article 17.1), and the controller needs to transmit this information to the other controllers processing the same personal data.
<br>
Furthermore, the GDPR rights and obligations that were classified as an information flow were then studied with the purpose of assessing 
which informational elements need to be represented in order to support this stream of information.
For instance, if a personal data breach occurs, the controller is obliged to 
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-34-gdpr/" target="_blank">communicate it to data subject</a> and provide information 
regarding the <a href="https://protect.oeg.fi.upm.es/def/gdprif#I46" target="_blank">nature of the data breach</a>, 
the <a href="https://protect.oeg.fi.upm.es/def/gdprif#I40" target="_blank">identity</a> and 
<a href="https://protect.oeg.fi.upm.es/def/gdprif#I5" target="_blank">contact details</a> of the data protection officer,
detailed information about the likely <a href="https://protect.oeg.fi.upm.es/def/gdprif#I49" target="_blank">consequences of the personal data breach</a> 
and the <a href="https://protect.oeg.fi.upm.es/def/gdprif#I50" target="_blank">measures used to address and mitigate the data breach's effects</a>.
<br>
A complete list of elements of information was manually collected for each identified information flow and is systematised in the following table.
In addition, for each described item, a list of GDPR’s articles where they are mentioned is also presented for readers to be able to refer to the regulation.
