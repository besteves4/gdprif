<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">

The GDPR Information Flows (GDPRIF) ontology aims to provide a tool to refer to the rights and obligations established in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in terms of information flows that occur between GDPR stakeholders. In this context, an information flow refers to information that must be transmitted from one stakeholder to the other so that a right or obligation can be invoked and granted. Therefore, GDPRIF provides a way to model the relationships between GDPR stakeholders, the identified items of information that need to be exchanged, GDPR rights and obligations, and also to specify the flows of information and the events that trigger such flows. GDPRIFâ€™s rights and obligations are modelled as ODRL policies complemented by DPV, DPV-GDPR and GDPRtEXT.
